minor_changes:
  - add ClusterOperator to waiter.py - Adding the ability for waiter.py to get the health of an openshift cluster by getting the ClusterOperator. All operators must return 'Available: True', 'Degraded: False', 'Progressing: False' in order for waiter.py to return True. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/kubernetes.core/issues/869)
