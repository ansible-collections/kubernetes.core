security_fixes:
  - kubeconfig - Implement fine-grained kubeconfig sanitization in logs as a temporary workaround. When kubeconfig is provided as a dictionary, sensitive fields (tokens, certificates, keys) are now automatically hidden in Ansible logs while preserving the overall structure for debugging (https://github.com/ansible-collections/kubernetes.core/pull/975).
